Hi! I'm Gustavo, aka VedaComputing, I enjoy technology and computer science. 
I like doing personal projects, which you will find in the portfolio page of this website. 
My specialties can be found on the homepage, of which most are web development, DevOps or cyber security.

I'm working on improving other as a teacher and with tutorials in my blog and in Youtube videos. I enjoy doing open source projects and development to help other understand the work that is done.

As a SysAdmin, I always look to improve my knowledge and the tools that I use to get more time for the work that I put in, this in other helps me learn and share this tricks and ideas that can be implemented in any aspect of computer work.
