I being working for a few days to get this website going, to showcase my work, what I like, and everything Realted to myself and my learning experiences.

Now I have a brand new Hugo website

* A homepage with more social links, and description of my skills
* An about page with description of who I am
* A portfolio page to showcase all my projects
* A blog
* A tutorial page to aggregate all tutorials posted on youtube (to come)
* A Learning page to aggregate all courses that I have done in linkedin Learning (to come)

### Why Hugo?
The first question is why a *site builder*? I'm competent at web development, why not just write it all myself? The markdown processing makes it much easier to just write words, not having to think about the formatting, and if I'm going to blog often, then I'll need that.

I picked Hugo over other *site builders* by what I saw that it provided, also I found a theme that worked perfectly for my needs and thus I chose it and I customized it to be able to pull API requests to automate cataloging of my projects (from Github), tutorials (from Youtube), and Courses studied (from linkeding).

### Why start blogging?
A great questions, Blogging is a Great way to showcase work, impart knowledge and create a easy to follow tutorial, and put all of my opinions in a simple format, it allows for others to find it easily and to discuss what they think is right or wrong about my point of view, always allowing both parties to grow.

### So what can I expect to see in the blog?
The current plan is for the vast majority of posts to be technical guides on how to do things, but there might be some variety if I want to blog about events.
